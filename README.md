# goPR

Get Native OSX Notifications for GitHub Pull Requests (open PRs, comments, etc)

# TODO:
* Show multiple notifications for lots of changes?
* Document how to config

# Why not script terminal-notifier with the GH cli?
For example use terminal-notifier with a diff of `gh pr status`.
Yeah, I could have. But it is about the GoLang practice alright?
